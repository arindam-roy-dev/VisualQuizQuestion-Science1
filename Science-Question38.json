"aboutAnswer":"A magnifying glass (called a hand lens in laboratory contexts) is a convex lens that is used to produce a magnified image of an object.\nThe lens is usually mounted in a frame with a handle (see image). A magnifying glass can be used to focus light, such as to concentrate the sun\'s radiation to create a hot spot at the focus for fire starting."
