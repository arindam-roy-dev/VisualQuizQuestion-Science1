"aboutAnswer":"Ohm\'s law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points.\nIntroducing the constant of proportionality, the resistance, one arrives at the usual mathematical equation that describes this relationship: I=V/R.\nwhere I is the current through the conductor in units of amperes, V is the voltage measured across the conductor in units of volts, and R is the resistance of the conductor in units of ohms.\nMore specifically, Ohm\'s law states that the R in this relation is constant, independent of the current.\nOhm\'s law is an empirical relation which accurately describes the conductivity of the vast majority of electrically conductive materials over many orders of magnitude of current. However some materials do not obey Ohm\'s law, these are called non-ohmic."
