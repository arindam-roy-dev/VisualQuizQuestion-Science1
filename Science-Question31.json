"aboutAnswer":"A dump truck, known also as a dumper truck or tipper truck is used for taking dumps (such as sand, gravel, or demolition waste) for construction.\nA standard dump truck is a truck chassis with a dump body mounted to the frame. The bed is raised by a vertical hydraulic ram mounted under the front of the body, or a horizontal hydraulic ram and lever arrangement between the frame rails, and the back of the bed is hinged at the back of the truck.\nThe tailgate can be configured to swing up on top hinges (and sometimes also to fold down on lower hinges) or it can be configured in the \"High Lift Tailgate\" format wherein pneumatic rams lift the gate open and up above the dump body."
