"aboutAnswer":"A binary number is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, a method of mathematical expression which uses only two symbols: typically \"0\" (zero) and \"1\" (one).\nThe base-2 numeral system is a positional notation with a radix of 2. Each digit is referred to as a bit, or binary digit.\nBecause of its straightforward implementation in digital electronic circuitry using logic gates, the binary system is used by almost all modern computers and computer-based devices, as a preferred system of use, over various other human techniques of communication, because of the simplicity of the language.\nThe modern binary number system was studied in Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries by Thomas Harriot, Juan Caramuel y Lobkowitz, and Gottfried Leibniz. However, systems related to binary numbers have appeared earlier in multiple cultures including ancient Egypt, China, and India. Leibniz was specifically inspired by the Chinese I Ching.\nThe numeric value represented in each case is dependent upon the value assigned to each symbol. In the earlier days of computing, switches, punched holes and punched paper tapes were used to represent binary values.\nIn a modern computer, the numeric values may be represented by two different voltages; on a magnetic disk, magnetic polarities may be used. A \"positive\", \"yes\", or \"on\" state is not necessarily equivalent to the numerical value of one; it depends on the architecture in use."
