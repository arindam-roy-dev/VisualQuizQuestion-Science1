"aboutAnswer":"A capacitor is a passive two-terminal electronic component that stores electrical energy in an electric field. The effect of a capacitor is known as capacitance. A capacitor is a component designed to add capacitance to a circuit. The capacitor was originally known as a condenser or condensator.\nMost capacitors contain at least two electrical conductors often in the form of metallic plates or surfaces separated by a dielectric medium."
