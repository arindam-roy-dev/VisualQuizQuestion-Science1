"aboutAnswer":"A sector antenna is a type of directional microwave antenna with a sector-shaped radiation pattern. The word \"sector\" is used in the geometric sense; some portion of the circumference of a circle measured in degrees of arc. 60°, 90° and 120° designs are typical, often with a few degrees \'extra\' to ensure overlap and mounted in multiples when wider or full-circle coverage is required.\nThe largest use of these antennas is as antennas for cell phone base-station sites. They are also used for other types of mobile communications, for example in WiFi networks. They are used for limited-range distances of around 4 to 5 km."
