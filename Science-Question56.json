"aboutAnswer":"Volkswagen is a German automaker founded on 28 May 1937 by the German Labour Front, headquartered in Wolfsburg. It is the flagship marque of the Volkswagen Group, the largest automaker by worldwide sales in 2016 and 2017.\nThe group\'s biggest market is in China, which delivers 40% of its sales and profits.\nVolkswagen translates to \"people\'s car\" in German. The company\'s current international advertising slogan is just \"Volkswagen\", referencing the name\'s meaning.\nIn the early 1930s cars were a luxury: most Germans could afford nothing more elaborate than a motorcycle. Only one German out of 50 owned a car. Seeking a potential new market, some car makers began independent \"people\'s car\" projects – the Mercedes 170H, Adler AutoBahn, Steyr 55, and Hanomag 1.3L, among others.\nThe trend was not new, as Béla Barényi is credited with having conceived the basic design in the mid-1920s. Josef Ganz developed the Standard Superior (going as far as advertising it as the \"German Volkswagen\"). In Germany, the company Hanomag mass-produced the 2/10 PS \"Kommissbrot\", a small, cheap rear-engined car, from 1925 to 1928. Also, in Czechoslovakia, the Hans Ledwinka\'s penned Tatra T77, a very popular car amongst the German elite, was becoming smaller and more affordable at each revision."
