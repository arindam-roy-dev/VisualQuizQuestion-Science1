"aboutAnswer":"Saturn has 82 known moons, 53 of which have formal names. In addition, there is evidence of dozens to hundreds of moonlets with diameters of 40–500 meters in Saturn\'s rings, which are not considered to be true moons.\nTitan, the largest moon, comprises more than 90% of the mass in orbit around Saturn, including the rings. Saturn\'s second-largest moon, Rhea, may have a tenuous ring system of its own, along with a tenuous atmosphere.\nTitan is the largest moon of Saturn and the second-largest natural satellite in the Solar System. It is the only moon known to have a dense atmosphere, and the only known body in space, other than Earth, where clear evidence of stable bodies of surface liquid has been found.\nTitan is one of seven gravitationally rounded moons in orbit around Saturn, and the second most distant from Saturn of those seven. Frequently described as a planet-like moon, Titan is 50% larger (in diameter) than Earth\'s Moon and 80% more massive. It is the second-largest moon in the Solar System after Jupiter\'s moon Ganymede, and is larger than the planet Mercury, but only 40% as massive.\nDiscovered in 1655 by the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens, Titan was the first known moon of Saturn, and the sixth known planetary satellite (after Earth\'s moon and the four Galilean moons of Jupiter). Titan orbits Saturn at 20 Saturn radii.\nFrom Titan\'s surface, Saturn subtends an arc of 5.09 degrees and, were it visible through the moon\'s thick atmosphere, would appear 11.4 times larger in the sky than the Moon from Earth.\nTitan is primarily composed of ice and rocky material, which is likely differentiated into a rocky core surrounded by various layers of ice, including a crust of ice Ih and a subsurface layer of ammonia-rich liquid water.\nThe atmosphere of Titan is largely nitrogen; minor components lead to the formation of methane and ethane clouds and heavy organonitrogen haze. The climate—including wind and rain—creates surface features similar to those of Earth, such as dunes, rivers, lakes, seas (probably of liquid methane and ethane), and deltas, and is dominated by seasonal weather patterns as on Earth. With its liquids (both surface and subsurface) and robust nitrogen atmosphere, Titan\'s methane cycle bears a striking similarity to Earth\'s water cycle, albeit at the much lower temperature of about 94 K (−179.2 °C; −290.5 °F)."
